 1. Can you develop and run an Angular app without CLI?	

 2. How can custom annotations be created? practical scenarios where custom decorators are useful: As functions taking para,meters or without parametrs on class, method, property, parametrs.
Eg: to make a class property readonly.

3. Pipes : format output. eg: {{propertname | date: "MM/dd/yy" }}.
          Custom pipes: @Pipe({name: 'exponentialStrength'})
          export class ExponentialStrengthPipe implements PipeTransform


4. State Management using Cookies/Local Storage/Session Storage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKPfiQQz5hY
    Cookies: for server side use.
    Local Storage: browser client side use.
    Session Storage: browser side usage but lifetime until browser window closes.
    
5. Configure Async HTTP Calls through .NET Core APIs: Pending

6. Ng builds using webpack in behind the scenes angular cli:
Angular CLI loads its configuration from .angular-cli.json
Angular CLI runs Webpack to build and bundle all JavaScript and CSS code
Angular CLI starts Webpack dev server to preview the result on localhost:4200.

7. Javascript:
 • Modular : 
• Prototype Design Patterns
• IIFe Functions
• Closures
• JavaScript vulnerabilities 

8.  PDF generation using mvc razor and html helpers: Rotativa nuget package: converts html to pdf.  Write action for viewing data and then actionasPDF. https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/335595/Rotativa-how-to-print-PDF-in-Asp-Net-MVC
